## Overview

A project for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images with and without St. George.

## Getting Started

Provide information on how to set up and run your project.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Pillow
- Shutil

### Installation

Installed the required packages.
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib

## Usage

The project can be used for image classification of 2 classes.

### Dataset Preparation

The Dataset is downloaded from the given source, and stored in a seperate location.
The Directories are classified in the below format.

    ├── Selected/
        ├── Dataset/
            ├── george/
            │   ├── image1.jpg
            │   ├── image2.jpg
            │   └── ...
            └── no_george/
                ├── image1.jpg
                ├── image2.jpg
                └── ...

Duplicate files are removed from each directory.

#The images are segrigated for train, validation, test and stored in different directories.

Training dataset are stored in the below format,

    ├── Selected/
       ├── Train/
            ├── george/

            └── no_george/
                ├── image1.jpg
                ├── image2.jpg
                └── ...

                ├── image2.jpg
                └── ...

Testing dataset are stored in the below format,

   ├── Selected/
       ├── Test/
            ├── george/
            │   ├── image1.jpg
            │   ├── image2.jpg
            │   └── ...
            └── no_george/
                ├── image1.jpg
                ├── image2.jpg
                └── ...               

### Labeling

The Data is label according to their directories.

Number of classes: 2
Class labels: {'george': 0, 'no_george': 1}

Labelled data is normalised

### Training

The Convolutional Neural Network is used to train the Machine Learing model.
